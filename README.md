Chatbot Using Speech Recognition
This project is a speech-enabled chatbot that leverages speech recognition and natural language processing (NLP) technologies. It allows users to interact with the chatbot through voice commands, enabling conversational AI on websites or other applications.

Features
Speech-to-Text: Converts user speech into text using Google Speech-to-Text API.
Natural Language Processing: Processes user input and extracts intent using machine learning techniques.
Text-Based Interaction: Also supports text-based chat for users who prefer typing.
Real-Time Response: Responds to user queries in real-time with relevant answers.
Simple Web Interface: Front-end built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a seamless user experience.
Easy to Customize: Modify the chatbot to handle various queries and improve interaction.
Technologies Used
Python: Back-end processing for speech recognition and NLP.
JavaScript: Front-end functionality and chatbot interface.
HTML/CSS: Web interface for the chatbot.
Google Speech-to-Text API: Converts spoken language into text.
NLTK: For natural language processing.
Flask/Express: Frameworks for running the back-end service (depending on the version you choose).
Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x
Node.js (for running the web interface)
Flask/Express (based on whether you choose Python or JavaScript back-end)
Google Speech-to-Text API: Set up an API key from the Google Cloud Console.
Setup
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Chatbot-Using-Speech-Recognition.git
cd Chatbot-Using-Speech-Recognition
2. Set Up Python Environment
Create a virtual environment and install dependencies.

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Set Up Google Speech API
Go to the Google Cloud Console and enable the Speech-to-Text API.
Download the credentials JSON file and place it in the project directory.
Set up the environment variable for authentication:
bash
Copy code
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="path_to_credentials.json"
4. Run the Application
To start the chatbot, run the following command in the project directory:

bash
Copy code
python app2.py
For the JavaScript version:

bash
Copy code
node app2.js
Open a browser and go to http://localhost:5000 to interact with the chatbot.

File Structure
app2.py: Main Python back-end script for chatbot logic and speech recognition.
app2.js: JavaScript alternative for the back-end.
base2.html: HTML file for the chatbot’s front-end.
style2.css: CSS file for styling the web interface.
images/: Contains image assets for the web interface.
Website/: Contains additional web resources.
Website Template.zip: Zipped version of the web template.
Customization
Change NLP Model: Modify the NLP part in app2.py to enhance the chatbot’s understanding of user intents.
Add Responses: Update response logic in app2.py or app2.js to suit your needs.
Update Front-End: Edit base2.html and style2.css to redesign the user interface.
